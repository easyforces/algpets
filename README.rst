Algorithm Snippets
=================

For code competitions like CodeForces and TopCoder, there should be some
template. But for code clean, we shouldn't add all content into a single file.
That is why there should be a plugin like this.

Install
-------

Add code below to your .vimrc if you use **Bundle** as vim plugin manager.

.. code:: shell

   Bundle 'easyforces/algpets'
